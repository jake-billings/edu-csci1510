# Lab03 #

### Part 1 ###
The objective of lab03 part 1 is to design the logic for an integrated circuit that results in a true value if and only if a single output does not match all other outputs.

For instance, using the inputs w, x, y, z, the circuit will return a HIGH value if w, x, and y are 1 but z is 0.

In order to reinforce the concept that all posible logic circuits can be built using NAND gates, the lab requires that all logic be designed using only NAND gates.

### Part 2 ###
The object of lab03 part 2 is to design the logic for an integrated circuit that generates parity bits based on the section describing the logic in the textbook.

As in part 1, only NAND gates can be used.
