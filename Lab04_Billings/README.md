# Lab04 #

The object of Lab04 was to demonstrate understanding of OrCad parts and binary addition by creating Half, Full, and 2-Bit adders. This lab contains a 2-Bit adder comprised of two full adders comprised of two half adders. All implementations use the OrCad part system.

All adders were simulated using PSpice.
