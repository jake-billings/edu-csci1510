Whoa! This should not be public. This is a repository I use to backup my work for the class CSCI1510 at University of Colorado Denver. If you're reading this, there's a good chance this repository has been made public by accident. Please let me know at [jake.billings@ucdenver.edu](mailto:jake.billings@ucdenver.edu). In the mean time, adhere to the university's honor code for work in the class.

My personal email is [jake@jakebillings.com](mailto:jake@jakebillings.com) in case there are any issues with my institutional email.
